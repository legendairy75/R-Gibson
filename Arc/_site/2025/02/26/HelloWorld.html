<h2 id="welcome">Welcome</h2>

<p>My name Is <strong>Cameron</strong>, I have been programming and building electronics since I was 10 and for the past several months I have been learning web development. I decided to start This blog to write about what I do and how I do it.</p>

<h2 id="learning-web-development">Learning Web Development</h2>

<p>I started messing with Javascrypt and html when I was 10 but quickly grew to dislike it do to its complexity for a kid and the lack of an attention span to pursue it. Later in high school I was put in an IT class where half way through the second semester the teacher decided to teach us a bit of web development, though we only really learned how to make a webpage</p>

<h3 id="why">Why</h3>

<p>After high school I went to college for a bachelors in computer engineering, 3 years in after some scheduling issues and a family emergency I decided to take some time off from college to help my family. During that time I quickly found myself with nothing to do most of the day, then I remembered That I had bought a course off of <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> for web development. I then spent every spare moment studying the course, it took 8 months (1 month off) to get through the course but after that I had the information I needed to start developing web apps on my own.</p>

<h3 id="how">How</h3>

<p>The course is <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp">The Web Developer Bootcamp</a> by Colt Steele an I highly recommend it. Its a pretty lengthy course with 73 hours of content starting with basic html to using <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a> to make a full CRUD web app and the course is updated roughly once a year. The course also includes <a href="https://react.dev/">React</a> whitch I have yet to get into but will soon.</p>

<h2 id="end">End</h2>

<p>I plan to become a freelance web developer with what I have learned and will continue to learn so if you need a website go <a href="https://www.ron-gibson.com">here</a></p>

<p>Thank you for reading,</p>

<p>R. Gibson</p>
