📝 Cameron’s Engineering Notebook

This repository contains the source files and content for my technical blog and public engineering notebook.

It serves as a living knowledge base documenting what I’m learning, building, and breaking while studying:

Linux

DevOps & infrastructure

Homelab projects

Automation & scripting

Cloud, containers, and networking

The goal is to keep raw, practical notes and polished posts in one place — both for my own reference and for anyone else on a similar learning path.
