# Hello World

If you are reading this, it means that my blog finally exists - which means I stopped thinking about making it and actually made it.

This site is my **public workbench**.

I'm learning Linux, DevOps, infrastructure, automation, and how modern systems are built and operated. Instead of keeping everything hidden in a private notebook (which will someday end up in a box, never to be seen again), I decided to document what I'm doing, what breaks, what I fix, and what I learn along the way.

Not as a polished "expert tutorial" blog - but as a **real-time engineering journal**.

## Why This Blog Exists

I'm building towards a career in DevOps / infrastructure engineering. I *don't have a traditional degree in Computer Science*, but I **do have a home lab, an obsession with learning how systems work, and a willingness to break things repeatedly until I understand them**.

This blog exists to:

- Track my learning in public
- Prove what I can actually do
- Build a real portfolio instead of just a resume
- Share useful things I wish someone had written for me

## What You'll Find Here

You can expect posts about:

- **Linus internals** & system administration
- **Homelab builds** and services
- **Self-hosting**, automation, and infrastructure
- Containers, virtual machines, CI/CD, and cloud-like setups
- Real problems, real mistakes, real fixes

If something breaks - it's probably becoming a blog post.

## Why Public?

Because real engineers don't magically "know things" - they **build**, **test, fail, fix, and document**.

This is me doing that, in public

If this blog helps even one person avoid a few hours of debugging hell, it's already doing its job.

Welcome to **The Mad Lab**.
